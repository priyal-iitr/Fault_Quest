# Fault_Quest
This repository contains the project files which are used to generate a test vector required to identify the fault at a given node in a given circuit.
This is the README file for the project developed during the 2023 Girl Hackathon Ideathon Round. The project name is "Fault Quest" and it aims to implement an efficient and robust algorithm for Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG) to identify structural faults in manufactured chips at specific nodes in a given circuit
